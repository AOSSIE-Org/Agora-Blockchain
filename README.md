# Agora Blockchain

## Introduction

Agora is a library of voting algorithms like `Moore's`, `Oklahoma` , `Borda` , `IRV` etc. Some of these voting algorithms are already implemented by AOSSIE in a centralized manner using Scala as their backend. Our vision is to take these algorithms on a decentralized platform, so that, crucial votes of the voters could not be tampered with by admins, hackers, or anyone with access to the database. Blockchain technology would make the ballots immutable and hence more secure.

   ```

5. **Compile & Deploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/<ContractModule> --network <Network> --verify
   ```

## Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Create an `.env.local` file** with the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=<your_pinata_jwt>
   ```

5. **Visit the Live App at**:

## üß™ Running Tests Locally

## Frontend Tests

Before pushing your changes, run the frontend tests to ensure everything is working correctly. Follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ change working directory  
change working directory to `/client`:
```
cd client
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies  
Make sure all required packages are installed:
```bash
npm install  
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests  
Execute the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Ensure all tests pass before creating a PR to maintain code quality! üöÄ


## About smart contracts

The architecture of your Election Factory contract is designed to facilitate the creation and management of elections on the blockchain, incorporating cross-chain voting capabilities through Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Below is a detailed explanation:

### Overview

The `ElectionFactory` contract serves as the core component of the election creation and management system. It is responsible for generating new election instances, handling cross-chain voting, and maintaining a record of active elections. The contract leverages several other contracts and libraries to achieve its functionality, including the `Election`, `BallotGenerator`, and `ResultCalculator` contracts, as well as Chainlink's CCIP components.

- ### Key Features:

  - Election Creation: Utilizes a clonable election template (electionGenerator) to efficiently create new election contracts.
  - Ballot and Result Handling: Generates ballots using the BallotGenerator contract and calculates election results with a dedicated ResultCalculator contract.
  - Cross-Chain Voting: Implements Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to allow voting from multiple blockchain networks.

- ### Efficiency and Security:

  - Clonable Contracts: Reduces deployment costs and resource usage by cloning a pre-deployed election template.
  - Owner Management: Ensures only the election creator can delete or modify their election, providing security and control.
  - Whitelisted Cross-Chain Communication: Only allows approved contracts to send votes across chains, preventing unauthorized access.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create an Issue**: For any feature requests, bugs, security concerns, or other issues, please create an issue in the repository and wait to be assigned before proceeding.
2. **Branch Management**: Always create a new branch on your forked repository to commit your changes.
3. **Pull Request Descriptions**: When submitting a pull request (PR), provide a detailed explanation in the description, outlining all changes and the reasons behind them.
4. **Community Engagement**: Post your issues and PR updates on the Agora-Blockchain [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/HrJ6eKJ28a) for visibility and discussion.

## Additional Points to Remember

1. **Testing and Code Quality**: Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested, and avoid introducing code smells.
2. **Small Changes**: If a frontend change involves fewer than 20 lines of code or if you are making documentation updates, you may directly create a PR without prior assignment.
3. **Assignment Requirement**: Do not submit unassigned PRs; they will be closed without review.
4. **Avoiding Overlap**: Before starting work, check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicating efforts or conflicting changes.
5. **Open Review Period**: A new issue or PR will remain open for one week to allow other contributors to review and suggest improvements.
6. **Mentor Notification**: If your PR is left unattended for more than 1-2 weeks, depending on the contribution size, feel free to tag the mentors of Agora-Blockchain to get their attention.
7. **Completion Timeline**: An issue is expected to be completed within 5-30 days, depending on its complexity. If not completed within this timeframe, it may be reassigned to another contributor.
8. **Progress Updates**: If your work on an issue is taking longer than expected, ensure you provide regular updates in the issue‚Äôs or PR's comments to keep everyone informed.
9. **Working on Blockchain Components**:
   - **Error Interface Changes**: If modifying an interface for errors, ensure the corresponding error is added to `client/app/helper/ErrorMessage.ts`.
   - **Contract ABI Updates**: For changes to `ElectionFactory`, `Election`, or `CCIPSender` contracts, manually update the ABI files in `client/abi/artifacts/` (do not configure Hardhat to generate these paths automatically in the client directory).
